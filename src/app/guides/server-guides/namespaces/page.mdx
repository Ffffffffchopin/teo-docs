# Namespaces

Namespaces are for code splitting, organizing and reusing. Teo supports multiple databases. 
Each namespace can have its own connector. If a namespace doesn't have a connector, the 
parent one is inherited.

Write namespaces with the `namespace` block:

```teo
namespace user {
    model User {
        @id @autoIncrement @readonly
        id: Int
        name: String
    }
}
```
