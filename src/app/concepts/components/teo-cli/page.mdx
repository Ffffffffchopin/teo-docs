# Teo CLI

A Teo server application can be started with both Teo CLI and itself. It
supports several commands:
- `serve` the default command, start the server
- `generate` generate model entities or query clients
- `migrate` run migration only

## Serve

Use `serve` to start a server.

```sh
teo serve
```

## Generate

`generate client` generates the query client.

```sh
teo generate client
```

`generate entity` generates the model entities.

```sh
teo generate entity
```
