# Action

Traditional HTTP frameworks expose endpoints. Actions are Teo's HTTP endpoints.
Action can be nested, too. For example, to fetch a user with his posts, nested
`findMany` on post is also triggered. In the future, other types of
communications may be supported.

## HTTP request handlers

When working with HTTP requests, the requests are mapped into handler actions
with predefined rules.

When Teo's frontend packages are building a request url, they use a form of
`/{prefix}/{model-name}/action/{actionAame}`. For example, to access
`findMany` on `users`, we request this url: `/users/action/findMany`.

The actions supported by Teo are:

* `findUnique` find a unique object
* `findMany` find many objects
* `findFirst` find one object
* `create` create a new object
* `update` update an existing object
* `upsert` create an existing object if it doesn't exist
* `copy` copy an existing object into a new one
* `delete` delete an existing object
* `createMany` create many objects
* `updateMany` update many objects
* `copyMany` create many objects by copying
* `deleteMany` delete many objects
* `count` count matched objects
* `aggregate` view statistics data on this model
* `groupBy` view grouped statistics data on this model
* `signIn` create a new session of this identity
* `identity` get the identity which is represented by the auth token

> `copy` and `copyMany` are not supported yet.

## Disabling

Some of the actions exposed by Teo may not be needed for your business
requirements. You can disable some of them with `@disable` decorator.

```teo showLineNumbers
@disable(.update | .delete)
model Demo {

}
```

In this example, objects of this model cannot be updated or deleted. Once
created, it is what it is.

## Action transformer

Developers can modify action's passed in parameter with a pipeline.

```teo showLineNumbers /@action/
@action($when(.delete, $set("update", { "deletedAt": $now }).redirect(.update))
        .when(.find, $set(["where", "deletedAt"], null))
        .when(.find | .single, $redirect(.find | .first)))
model User {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  name: String
  deletedAt: DateTime?
}
```

In this example, soft delete is implemented with Teo's powerful action
transformer.

## Going next

The next topic introduces
[**pipeline**](/concepts/components/teo-server/pipeline),
which brings business logic support for our model definitions and actions.
