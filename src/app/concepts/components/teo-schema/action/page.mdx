# Action

> This article is outdated and it will be updated.

Action can be nested, too. For example, to fetch a user with his posts, nested
`findMany` on post is also triggered.

## Action transformer

Developers can modify action's passed in parameter with a pipeline.

```teo showLineNumbers /@action/
@action($when(.delete, $set("update", { "deletedAt": $now }).redirect(.update))
        .when(.find, $set(["where", "deletedAt"], null))
        .when(.find | .single, $redirect(.find | .first)))
model User {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  name: String
  deletedAt: DateTime?
}
```

In this example, soft delete is implemented with Teo's powerful action
transformer.

## Going next

The next topic introduces
[**pipeline**](/concepts/components/teo-schema/pipeline),
which brings business logic support for our model definitions and actions.
