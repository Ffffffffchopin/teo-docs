# Tson

Tson is Teo extended Json for working with Teo. Teo has data types such as
`ObjectId`, `Date` and `DateTime` which Json cannot express. The usage is
almost the same as rust's famous
[`serde_json`](https://github.com/serde-rs/json). Most of the times, developers
don't need to interact with Tson APIs. But if custom callbacks are provided,
developers need to call object methods and tson APIs are exposed.

## Usages

A tson hashmap is declared with `tson!({})`.

```rust
tson!({"key": 1, "value": 1})
```

A tson vec is declared with `tson!([])`.

```rust
tson!([true, false])
```

A tson null is declared with `tson!(null)`.

```rust
tson!(null)
```
