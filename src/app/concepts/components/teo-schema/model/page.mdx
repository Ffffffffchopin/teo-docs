# Model

> This guide introduces the concept of model used in Teo server implementation.

A model is mapped into a table or collection in the underlying database, with
each of its fields mapped to a table column. This is similar to the ORM
concepts. Besides, a model has a list of handlers which is equivalent to HTTP
endpoints in traditional HTTP frameworks.

## Declare a model

A model is defined in Teo schema language like this.

```teo showLineNumbers
/// @name Platform User
///
/// Users on our platform.
model User {
  @id
  id: Int
  @unique
  email: String
  name: String
  @default(18)
  age: Int
}
```

A model has a primary index, at least a primary field. It optionally has a
documented `@name`. It can have any number of [indexes](/concepts/components/teo-schema/index-concept) <span class="concept">CONCEPT</span>.

## Virtual Model

A virtual model is a model which don't have a database table. It only supports
`create` and `createMany` action. If it has identity defined, `signIn` and
`identity` are also supported. To understand actions, check
[Action](/concepts/components/teo-schema/action)
<span class="concept">CONCEPT</span> topic.

A virtual model cannot have relationships since it's not existing in the
database. A virtual model also doesn't need a primary key.

```teo showLineNumbers
@virtual @beforeSave($self.validate("custom-programming-validator"))
model User {
  email: String
  password: String
}
```

In this example, the virtual users are created with custom code, and
authenticated with custom code, too.

table column.
