# Pipeline

Pipeline is an innovative and powerful tool and it provides data validation,
transformation, and custom callbacks. Developers can attach pipelines both to
models and to fields.

## A simple pipeline

Let's see a simple pipeline. This is field's `@onSet` pipeline. When a new
value is set on this field, firstly, it trims leading and trailing whitespaces.
Then validates its content against an email regular expression.

```teo showLineNumbers
model Demo {
  @onSet($trim.isEmail)
  email: String
}
```

## Stages

There are various stages to trigger pipelines, common stages include:

* Model stages
  * `beforeSave` before this object is saved into the database
  * `afterSave` after this object is saved into the database
  * `beforeDelete` before this object is deleted from the database
  * `afterDelete` after this object is deleted from the database
* Field stages
  * `onSet` when a new value is set
  * `onSave` when this object is being saved into the database
  * `identityChecker` is for identity checker fields only
  * `onOutput` when a value is being outputed into the result JSON

## Items

## Custom functions

A custom function can be provided to transform or validate values.

## Logical modifiers

A simple modifier is not enough sometimes when your logic goes complicated.
There are a lot of builtin modifiers such as `if` and `any`.

```teo showLineNumbers
/// @name Password
/// User's password.
@writeonly @recordPrevious @identityChecker($bcryptVerify($self.get(.password)))
@onSet($hasLength(8...16).isSecurePassword.bcryptSalt.when(.update, $validate($any(
  $self.get(.oldPassword).exists.bcryptVerify($self.previous(.password)),
  $self.get(.passwordResetToken).exists.eq($self.get(.passwordResetTokenFromUser).exists).self.set(.passwordResetToken, null)
))))
password: String
```

In this example, `$validate` restores context value after validation. `$any`
is valid if one of its modifiers is valid.

## Choose a modifier

Teo provides a lot of builtin modifiers, use them when there is one that suits
your need. Check server API documentation for a full list of modifiers.

## Going next

In the next article, [**identity**](/concepts/components/teo-schema/identity)
is introduced. Teo allows users of different models to sign in.
