# Handler

Traditional HTTP frameworks expose endpoints. Handlers are Teo's HTTP endpoints.
Handlers are different from [Actions](/docs/concepts/components/teo-schema/action).
Each predefined handler correspond to a predefined root level [action](/docs/concepts/components/teo-schema/action) <span className="concept">CONCEPT</span>.

## HTTP request handlers

When working with HTTP requests, the requests are mapped into handlers
with predefined rules.

When Teo's frontend packages are building a request url, they use a form of
`/{server path prefix}/{namespacePaths}/{ModelName}/{actionName}`. For example, to access
`findMany` on `User`, we request this url: `/User/findMany`.

The builtin handlers supported by Teo are:

* `findUnique` find a unique object
* `findMany` find many objects
* `findFirst` find one object
* `create` create a new object
* `update` update an existing object
* `upsert` create an existing object if it doesn't exist
* `copy` copy an existing object into a new one
* `delete` delete an existing object
* `createMany` create many objects
* `updateMany` update many objects
* `copyMany` create many objects by copying
* `deleteMany` delete many objects
* `count` count matched objects
* `aggregate` view statistics data on this model
* `groupBy` view grouped statistics data on this model

## Disabling

Some of the handlers exposed by Teo may not be needed for your business
requirements. You can disable some of them with `@action` decorator.

```teo showLineNumbers
@action(disable: .update | .delete)
model Demo {

}
```

In this example, objects of this model cannot be updated or deleted. Once
created, it is what it is.

## Going next

The next topic introduces
[**action**](/concepts/components/teo-server/action),
which is exactly what it going on when database mutation is triggered.
