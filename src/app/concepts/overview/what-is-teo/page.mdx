# What is Teo?

This article gives a high-level overview of what Teo is and how it works.

If you want to get started with a practical introduction and learn about
writing Teo server and generate clients, head over to the
**[Getting started](/getting-started)** documentation.

To learn more about the motivation for Teo, check out the
**[Why Teo?](/concepts/overview/why-teo)** page.

## What is Teo?

Teo is an open source next-generation web framework. It consists of the
following parts:

- **Teo Schema**: Intuitive and innovative schema language which is descriptive
and readable
- **Teo Server**: High performance server core written in Rust
- **Teo Query Client**: Auto-generated and type-safe query builder for multiple
platforms and languages

## How does Teo work?

Like any other server frameworks, developers write code, start server and
deploy. What is unique to Teo is most of the coding can be done with the
intuitive schema language. For features Teo schema language doesn't provide,
Teo allows developers to generate model entities and write code in most common
backend server languages.

### The Teo schema

Developers declare configurations, enums and models all within these schema
files. These files can be splitted and included. Here is an example of a
minimalist Teo schema.

```teo showLineNumbers
connector {
  provider .mysql
  url "mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/hello"
}

server {
  bind ("0.0.0.0", 5001)
}

client ts {
  provider .typeScript
  dest "../hello-client/"
  package true
  host "http://127.0.0.1:5001"
  gitCommit true
}

model User {
  @id @autoIncrement @readonly
  id: Int
  @unique @onSet($isEmail)
  email: String
  name: String?
}
```

With this schema, Teo synthesizes HTTP request handlers for the model entity
`User`. When server is running, the frontend apps can send request to create,
update, delete and read users.

### The Teo server

The schema accepts custom callback functions on both primitive types and model
entities. Teo generate model entities for developers to write custom logic and
code that Teo schema language doesn't provided. Let's see an example in Rust:

```rust
app_builder.callback("userBeforeSave", |user: User| async move {
    let first_post = Post::new(teon!({
        "title": "Untitled"
    })).await;
    user.add_to_posts(vec![first_post]).await;
    Ok(())
});
```

In this example, developer runs some custom code and create a relation object
for the user object.

### The Teo query client

Teo cares about developer experience. Instead of copy and paste data transfer
objects into different frontend projects, Teo generate for us. For example, to
access the aforementioned `User` model, with TypeScript client, we can do:

```ts showLineNumbers
const createResult = await teo.user.create({
  create: {
    email: "ada2@teocloud.io",
    name: "Ada",
  }
})
console.log(createResult.data)
```

Teo query client is type-safe. It gives developers a feel of intellisense.

## Typical Teo workflows

In a developer's technical stack, Teo's role is serving as both ORM and HTTP
framework. Teo simplifies the backend server development. Normally developers
update schemas and generate query clients. On server start, database migration
is automatically performed. This web server is performant, and reliable.

{/*

In this file, you configure several things:

- **Connector conf**: Specifies your database connection
- **Data model**: Defines your models and fields for each model
- **Server conf**: Specify server configurations
- **Query client generator**: Indicates what clients you want to generate
- **Model Entity generator**: Indicates what model entities you want to generate

Let's dive right into the most important part: data modeling.

### The Teo data model

In this section, the focus is on the data model. You can learn more about data
sources and clients on the respective docs pages.

#### Functions of Teo models

The data model is a collection of models. A model has two major functions:

- Represent a table in relational databases or a collection in MongoDB
- Represent a resource in the Teo HTTP API

Once a model is defined, you can generate type safe clients which support those
queries and mutations defined on this model.

#### Fields of Teo models

A field definition looks like this:

```rust
m.field("published", |f| {
    f.required().bool().default(false);
});
```

A model field represents a column in the database table or collection most of
the times.

There are also temporary fields which may not represent a real database table
column. For example, in a typical system that has end users, if a user want to
change his password, he needs to provide his old password. This old password
field is temporary and not persisted in the underlying database.

#### Modifier pipelines

The Teo models not only define their database shapes, but also define business
logics. That's what makes it an HTTP server instead of an ORM. See this
following code:

```rust
m.field("email", |f| {
    f.unique().required().string().on_set(|p| { p.is_email(); });
});
m.field("hello", |f| {
    f.required().string().on_set(|p| { p.transform(|s: String| { s + "!" }); });
});
```

- On creating the user object with user provided value, the format of `email`
is validated.
- The field value of `hello` is transformed with a custom transformer. */}
